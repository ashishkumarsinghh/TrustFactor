# TrustFactor

# Concept

People/product/businesses are sometimes good and sometimes bad. We mostly feel bad if we trust someone and then they break our trust.
Sometimes it happens unintentionally, but if someone is repeating such things every now and then, then it is important
to save the world from such kind of people.

The solution, people can report the bad incidents about other people/entity via any of their ids or they can report good incidents about
the people by any of their ids. This is important because not for everything people go and report to police, sometimes they don't have
proofs, sometimes it is just the trust which is broken. There could be false reports too, those needs to be checked.
Provide a score to that id and let people claim that id by proving by their IDs.

# Goals

This is about people. Giving credits to good people and making helps available to them whenever they require.
Making people aware of bad people and places. The trust score !
Check the trust score about people or business or product or any entity before making any transaction or connection, so that
you don't regret your decision later.

# Features

Add a business/person/place/product and write a review. Get the intensity from the user, SN, N, P, SP.
Maintain the score for that particular business based upon all the reviews.
Let people search about any entity and check the trust score, help them make the decision they will not regret later.
Let people know that their review had an impact, send them notifications when people search already added entity.
Maintain the stats of how many people are helped and how many people wrote negative and positive.

# Problems and challenges.

Most of the times, the name of the entity is not known, let people add more details later and let people register reviews by
images, names, videos, by vague properties or attributes of the entity. Ask them questions and guide them to write proper reviews.

Some of the times people might write bad reviews or good reviews intentionally, without any basis, just to improve or degrade
the score, there must be a check for such reviews.
